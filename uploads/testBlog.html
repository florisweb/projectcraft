<h1>1. History of the World</h1>

<h2>1.1 Creation</h2>
From a source unknown to any race 7 celestials came into being. Sol, Luna, Hendal, Sintai, Endar, Höf and Kain. They found themselves in a dark empty place. But they soon noticed that they had the power to change it. So to entertain themselves they changed this place to their playground. With unlimited time they would play every game that anyone ever could come up with, tried everything possible within and outside the possibilities of normal physics since even physics could be changed by these celestial beings. But with unlimited time and limited options to entertain yourselves you eventually get bored with everything. Even if there’s a billion things to entertain yourself. With unlimited time you’ll eventually have grown out of all of them.
	While being bored the celestials were thinking of something to do when Henve, they wouldn’t be as powerful as them but they woudal came with an idea. They would create a world where other sentient beings would live. They would be able to do some basic level of magic and be untouched by aging just like the celestials. Hendal called them elves. The others agreed. They would be gods of this world and watch over it.
	Because Hendal was the one who conceived this idea which created new sentience for the first time, the other celestials named him god of sentience.
But before they created the elves they first needed to create their world. So Kain created the stone on which the world would be build and put all the resources in it that the elves would need. to the world to make it more interesting. Thus he was named god of resources. 
	But the elves wouldn’t be able to see anything since there was no source of light and they weren’t powerful enough to create light themselves. One celestial wouldn’t be able to light this flat square world of 30 million on their own though so they needed two celestials to do the task. Sol and Luna took it upon themselves. They would work together, taking turns walking across the sky of the world, emitting light upon it. One such walk took about 12 hours, so Sol and Luna would both do one walk every 24 hours.
	But the stone that Kain created was bland, ugly, grey and depressing. So Endar created beautiful plants with beautiful colors and mighty trees. The plants and the trees would also work together to filter the air for the elves. Thus Endar was named god of nature
	But while the nature Endar created was beautiful, Höf thought it was boring as everything moved very slow if it even moved at all. So he created animals to bring more movement into the world and give the elves some extra companions. The animals would eat the plants and trees to make sure they wouldn’t grow out of hand but also each other to keep populations in check. In contrast to Elves these animals would die because of age. To process all the waste and bodies that came from the life that was created he also created smaller creatures who would consume it and put the resources that life used back into the ground. For this the celestials named Endar god of animals.
The world was finally done. They called it Helarus. Heldar created the Elves and everything was done. But the Elves did nothing, they didn’t have a goal so they just sat there. The celestials didn’t know what to do, how were they going to motivate the elves without taking away their sentience? But Sintai had an idea, she gave the elves emotion. She thought the best way to do it was to create a balance of bad and good emotions. Joy and sadness, fear and trust, calmness and anger, shame and confidence, anticipation and surprise. But the most important balance of emotions was love and hate. Thus Sintai was named god of love.

<h2>1.2 The Fall of the gods</h2>
For a long time the world was in perfect harmony. It is unknown how long this period of time lasted but it lasted for at least a thousand years. But Luna did not like how things were. While sol loved walking across the sky and looking at the Elves do their thing. She loved it. But Luna found it boring, walking across the sky for half of her time felt like a punishment. She wanted to go back to the old times, where it was just the 7 having fun. So she started to brew a plan.
  She made a plan so perfect that nobody saw it coming. She slowly corrupted the mind of some of the younger elves. She indoctrinated them from the moment they were born. Every elf born after a certain point was brainwashed by Luna. She waited a long time until she had enough followers. This took a long time since elves had very little children to keep the population in check.
It was a beautiful day when the attack happened. Suddenly the brainwashed younger elves started slaughtering the elves. Since war had never happened in the past nobody was prepared and weapons were a scarcity among the elves. The attack was quick and smooth. Luna had planned everything and the elves occupied.
  To counter this thread the gods decided to create an army. And thus humans were created. They would die of age and couldn't reproduce because they were genderless so that after the war they would vanish after a while and everything would return to how things were. They usually weren’t able to use magic so their power was limited. They were created to fight this war and nothing more. The war devastated the world and took forever. But after 98 years it finally ended with the battle for Enstal. But this battle was not without sacrifice.
  To end the suffering the gods had to make a sacrifice, they had to combine all their power to defeat Luna, who had become far more powerful than any other being that had ever lived. It would take them so much power that it weakened them all so much to the point of dying. But just before the fight they put some of their power into a stone which would make sure that the world could go on without them. It was named the lifestone. The fight happened and the gods died. But the war was won.
  Sintai, being the loving god she is. Felt bad that they had created the humans just to fight their war. So in her last breath she also gave them she split humans up into males and females and gave them the ability to reproduce just like the elves. They would still be heavily limited in their use of magic and die much more often than elves due to things like disease and aging but they had their change to create their own civilisations.
  What the gods didn’t know was that Luna had sensed the creation of the lifestone and corrupted it with a bit of her energy. Thus nights became a thing where monsters reigned.
  And so the first era ended. With a new race and the death of the gods. But a prophecy was made. One day the gods would gain enough power to emerge again from the stone. Luna would break free as well and a new dark age would dawn on the world. 
  Some of Luna’s elves escaped and went into hiding. Waiting for Luna to return. They would be called the dark elves. From them the religion of the one true god emerged. Which would worship Luna and always have a rivalry with the religion of the holy 6 who worshipped the other 6 gods.
  The battlefield became a cursed place. Temperatures raised to levels which made long time settling impossible and over time weird things started happening. No one has been there and returned for over 5000 years. Weird buildings have been seen from a distance though.

<h2>1.3 The second era</h2>
Humans had one big flaw. As a result of being created for war they had inherited a lust for power and anyone that could show of their power. This and the fact that elves looked down on humans as being good for nothing but fighting wars caused the second era to be characterised with war between elves and humans. The era took 3367 years. In this era, 2 new races came to be.
  First the halflings came to be. Some of the elves became tired of the wars and decided to settle somewhere far away. Over the ages they became smaller and smaller. They became a lazy people, only doing just enough to keep themselves alive. With a love for nature and peace these became the halflings.
  When an elf and a man fell in love and got a child, they became an outcast among both humans and elves. They settled somewhere in the mountains where they got more children. The children formed a new society. Having the lust for power of men but also the love for peace of elves they found a different way to gain their power. They started making big mines to extract lots of resources. Gold and diamonds was what they were looking for. Because they lived underground, they became very filthy and thus looks became less and less important in their romantic lives. Instead how fierce you looked became the main feature of attraction. Because of this they became uglier, but big for their size and they grew big beards. Even the woman started to get beards over time. They also got smaller because of the lack of light in the mines and so dwarves came to be.
  The second era ended when elves and men finally came to a peace agreement that lasted.

<h2>1.4 The third era</h2>
The third era was a largely peaceful one and has lasted for about 2000 years. Only having some small insignificant wars and some attacks from the dark elves. One new race did emerge.
  Sometime in the beginning of the third era, a group of 10 humans ventured to the sea and found a monument in the ocean with a weird green breed of pufferfish. They set up a camp on a small island close to the monument and after a week they begin their raid. 2 of them died and the rest went back to the surface to regroup. They created a great new kind of weapon that could help them in killing the guardians: the trident. With this weapon they managed to kill all of the elder guardians in the monument, but the last one cursed the humans and made the lower half of their body a fish tail. With this the tritons were born and the underwater city insert name here was founded
  1400 years into the third era, a human army fighting against a dark elf raid suddenly vanished. A couple years later, about 50 of the original 4 thousand strong army returned with a weird story. They were taken by another alien-like race who called themselves wraiths. They said they had come from a different dimension, banished by their god Naomi. Apparently she accidently locked herself into this world as well but lost most of her power and they were searching for her. Nobody knows when the wraiths entered Helarus but the elves say they had censed their power before not knowing what it was at first. It had been growing for a long time. The men who had returned told the wraiths’ plans of destroying the world and make it livable for them once they have enough power. The elves say that one day all the races have to bend together to fight them but only Naomi has the knowledge on how to defeat them for good.

<h2>1.5 A new threat</h2>
Recently rumors of a mysterious stone that fell out of the air near a human village called Hirei. All the inhabitants were killed except for one who talked about dark creatures with dark powers coming from the stone that killed everyone. The dark elves have started a new incursion as well. It seems like the world is in trouble once more. If the gods wanted to make their return, now would be a good time.

<h1>2. Races</h1>

<h2>2.1 Elves</h2>
The Elves were the first race on Helarus. And the only ones that were directly created by the gods with the intention to stay. Because of this they are also the most powerful individuals. Their numbers are low though. Even though they are untouched by age they can still die from wounds and from disease. But they rarely do. They do get children but not very often keeping their populations low which makes them vulnerable compared to other races. They are very powerful with magic but don’t often use it for bad since they have a love for peace and nature and don’t want to disturb this. Most of the elves worship the holy six but some worship the one true god, being quickly banished to join the dark elves when this is discovered by other elves.
They generally build using a lot of resources gathered from nature and keeping other resources to a minimum. They like to express their feelings and love for peace by using a lot of colors in their builds as well.. They generally live in normal houses but desire living in one of their huge life trees. But this is only for the really powerful elves since there aren’t a lot of these trees. 

<h2>2.2 Humans</h2>
As a result of being created solely for war at first they inherited some bad tendencies that tend to get them in war. An endless lust for power and being very materialistic. Often, they only hurt themselves while doing this. Especially the poorer humans. Because of this a lot of them have developed a love for peace like the elves. But many of them are still easily corrupted. Because of their long history of war with the elves and their easy corruption, the religion of the one true god has gotten a good grip on a good portion of humans. But most still worship the holy six.
  Their building style is very diverse. Being very good at adapting to different environments, they’re building style is often very well adapted to the biome they live in.

<h2>2.3 Dark Elves</h2>
The dark elves are full of hate towards people who don’t worship the one true god. Being in constant war mode and planning new attacks on the world all the time. But their hate makes them uncalculated which makes most of their attacks futile. They have to hide from humans and elves since their always looking to root them out and stop their constant pillaging. Because of this they live mostly underground. 
Like the elves they like to express their feelings in their builds. But because of their hate these buildings become very dark. Almost looking scary.

<h2>2.4 Halflings</h2>
Halflings are mostly forgotten by the rest of the world. Not taking part in any of the main wars and enjoying life to its fullest. They have lived in almost constant peace since their inception. They lost their magical powers that they inherited from their elf ancestors since they didn’t practise them enough. Their love for nature is even bigger than that of the elves. Living in houses that are built inside hills and having nature all around their villages. They love working the land either with crops or normal flowers because they feel closest to nature that way.
Their building materials include whatever nature around them provides.

<h2>2.5 Dwarves</h2>
Dwarves don’t like war which they inherited from their elf ancestors. But they do love power and are very materialistic which they inherited from their human ancestors and are more than willing to defend their belongings. To enrich themselves they spend a lot of their time mining for resources. Over time they started living underground so they didn’t have to travel to the mines so much. They became very fierce since the dwarves found this attractive and it gave them an edge when defending their belongings and their mining was heavy work.
  The dwarves build mostly underground in mountains. Only building some defensive structures outside. They create big underground cities and mining complexes.
<h2>2.6 Tritons</h2>
The tritons have stayed out of worldly affairs most of the time since they are underwater and hardly have any communication with the outside world. Mining is very hard underwater so they keep it very minimal, only gathering what they need to live. Because of this their materialism and love for power has become a lot less prominent. It’s still there though, mostly expressing itself with power struggles involving diplomatic games and not a lot of outright war.
  Their building style finds its origin in the water temples where the first Tritons where cursed to their underwater life. Using a lot of prismarine harvested from guardians. But they do use some other blocks as well. They have a lot of conduits around their cities which grant them extra power.

<h2>2.7 Wraiths</h2>
Not much is known about the wraiths or their living style. They are a lot different from any other race as a result of their completely different origins then any other race. They like sucking human blood whenever they can but aren’t seen very often because the sun burns them to death. A lot of legends are told about them but no one knows how much of it is actually true. What is clear is that they will become a serious threat one day but sadly no one knows how to deal with it for the time being.

<h1>3. Cities and Regions </h1>

<h2>3.1 Kallavik</h2>
Kallavik was one of the first settlements made by humans and the oldest human city still around. Because the snowy terrain kept elves away, this became a huge city during the wars of the first century. You can still see some of the militarization during the wars. In particular because of its plentiful and high walls. Though only the outer wall is still fully intact and manned in the present, you can still see some ruins of the old, inner walls while the rest was used in construction of new buildings.While the golden age of Kallavik is long gone, it’s still an important city. Giving access to the rest of the world through it’s big harbour.

<h2>3.2 Halfling Village</h2>
