<h1>1. History of the World</h1>

<h2>1.1 Creation</h2>
<a>From a source unknown to any race 7 celestials came into being. Sol, Luna, Hendal, Sintai, Endar, Höf and Kain. They found themselves in a dark empty place. <br>But they soon noticed that they had the power to change it. So to entertain themselves they changed this place to their playground. With unlimited time they would play every game that anyone ever could come up with, tried everything possible within and outside the possibilities of normal physics since even physics could be changed by these celestial beings. But with unlimited time and limited options to entertain yourselves you eventually get bored with everything. Even if there’s a billion things to entertain yourself. With unlimited time you’ll eventually have grown out of all of them.
    While being bored the celestials were thinking of something to do when Henve, they wouldn’t be as powerful as them but they woudal came with an idea. They would create a world where other sentient beings would live. They would be able to do some basic level of magic and be untouched by aging just like the celestials. Hendal called them elves. The others agreed. They would be gods of this world and watch over it.
    Because Hendal was the one who conceived this idea which created new sentience for the first time, the other celestials named him god of sentience.
But before they created the elves they first needed to create their world. So Kain created the stone on which the world would be build and put all the resources in it that the elves would need. to the world to make it more interesting. Thus he was named god of resources. 
    But the elves wouldn’t be able to see anything since there was no source of light and they weren’t powerful enough to create light themselves. One celestial wouldn’t be able to light this flat square world of 30 million on their own though so they needed two celestials to do the task. Sol and Luna took it upon themselves. They would work together, taking turns walking across the sky of the world, emitting light upon it. One such walk took about 12 hours, so Sol and Luna would both do one walk every 24 hours.
    But the stone that Kain created was bland, ugly, grey and depressing. So Endar created beautiful plants with beautiful colors and mighty trees. The plants and the trees would also work together to filter the air for the elves. Thus Endar was named god of nature
    But while the nature Endar created was beautiful, Höf thought it was boring as everything moved very slow if it even moved at all. So he created animals to bring more movement into the world and give the elves some extra companions. The animals would eat the plants and trees to make sure they wouldn’t grow out of hand but also each other to keep populations in check. In contrast to Elves these animals would die because of age. To process all the waste and bodies that came from the life that was created he also created smaller creatures who would consume it and put the resources that life used back into the ground. For this the celestials named Endar god of animals.
The world was finally done. They called it Helarus. Heldar created the Elves and everything was done. But the Elves did nothing, they didn’t have a goal so they just sat there. The celestials didn’t know what to do, how were they going to motivate the elves without taking away their sentience? But Sintai had an idea, she gave the elves emotion. She thought the best way to do it was to create a balance of bad and good emotions. Joy and sadness, fear and trust, calmness and anger, shame and confidence, anticipation and surprise. But the most important balance of emotions was love and hate. Thus Sintai was named god of love.</a>
